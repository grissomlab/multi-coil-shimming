function Y = aftershim04(coefficients,slice,fieldmap,slice_ori)
% Y = AFTERSHIM04(COEFFICIENTS,SLICE)
% returns field strength ( in Hz ) of one slice after 4-coil-shim
% shim terms : Z0, Z, X, Y
% input:
%   coefficients: Coefficients of field expansion
%   slice : the number of slice which is being shimmed
% output:
%   Y : field strength after shim
